FacebookConnect

###A simple class to connect to facebook###


I decided to make a simple class to connect to the Facebook API since I couldn't find a simple, reliable class out there.

###Setup###
Copy config-sample.json to config.json.  This file must not be accessible to the public to protect the data.  Perhaps block it with htaccess.

Edit config.json to include your facebook app information.
